# FUSION+

This project is based on the original **Fusion** by [deity]() and [deadshell](https://github.com/deadshxll), which is no longer maintained. *Fusion+* aims to carry the project forward with additional features, optimizations, and enhancements for personal use as well as for developers seeking a solid foundation for further customization.

## How to inject
Use a trusted DLL injector like [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) or [Xenos](https:://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos) to inject the cheat into Lunar Client. Press `Insert` to open the menu once it is injected.
> [!NOTE]
> I am planning to build a dedicated injector specifically for *Fusion+*.

### Why is this project open-source?
The goal of the original *Fusion* project was to provide a solid foundation for developers to build upon, and *Fusion+* continues this mission by offering an updated version with additional features and optimizations. By making this project open-source, I hope to provide a valuable resource for developers seeking to learn more about cheat development and improve their skills. I also welcome contributions from the community to help make *Fusion+* even better.

## Project Status
*Fusion+* is currently in active development, with new features and optimizations being added regularly. I want to to provide a high-quality cheat that is both reliable and easy to use. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please let me know by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.

### Planned Features
- [ ] Dedicated injector for *Fusion+*
- [x] Fix for ESP in third-person view
- [ ] Improved module list in the internal GUI
- [ ] Color customizations for different modules and internal GUI
- [ ] Config files for saving and loading cheat settings
- [x] Improved module system for developers

### Planned Modules
- [ ] **Arraylist**: Displays a list of the users active modules
- [ ] **BlockESP**: Displays blocks selected in the world
- [ ] **Chest Stealer**: Automatically steals items from chests
- [ ] **W-Tap**: Automatically W-taps for the user.
- [ ] **Bridge Assist**: Automatically ninja bridges for the user (without block placement).

### Notices
- This cheat currently works on Lunar Client 1.8.9 only, but may be updated to support other versions in the future.
- Some features, such as the ESP in third-person view, may experience minor issues when interacting with blocks. A solution is under development.
- After extended use, you may experience minor lag spikes, no solution was found.
- This cheat is nothing close to screen sharing proof, use at your own risk.
