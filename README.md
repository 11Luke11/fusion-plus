# FUSION+

This project is based on the original **Fusion** by [deity]() and [deadshell](https://github.com/deadshxll), which is no longer maintained. *Fusion+* aims to carry the project forward with additional features, optimizations, and enhancements for personal use as well as for developers seeking a solid foundation for further customization.

Open the injector in administrator mode and open Lunar Client. Once you are in the main menu, and the injector has detected Lunar Client, click on the `Inject` button. The cheat should now be injected into the game, and you can open the internal GUI by pressing `Insert`.

### Why is this project open-source?
The goal of the original *Fusion* project was to provide a solid foundation for developers to build upon, and *Fusion+* continues this mission by offering an updated version with additional features and optimizations. By making this project open-source, I hope to provide a valuable resource for developers seeking to learn more about cheat development and improve their skills. I also welcome contributions from the community to help make *Fusion+* even better.

## Project Status
*Fusion+* is currently in active development, with new features and optimizations being added regularly. I want to to provide a high-quality cheat that is both reliable and easy to use.
