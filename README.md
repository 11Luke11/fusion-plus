### IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO CHEAT USING FUSION AS YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE BANNED, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

A Lunar Client 1.8.9 Ghost Internal Cheat.

Released as a public repository by hackers for hackers, not pasters.

### Why is this a public release?
Because we wanted a decent resource for other cheat developers to use for when they are stuck with a certain problem when developing their cheats, NOT for random children to downlaod the project and pretend to know what they are doing.

### Notices
- This cheat only works on Lunar Client 1.8.9
- Your F11 key will be unbound in minecraft, the cheat will replace it with a borderless full screen.
- The ESP in works well in third person until your camera starts colliding with blocks, a solution was found however it was not very reliable.

### How to inject
I'd recommend using a trust worthy dll injector such as [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/), the reason why we did not make an injector is because this cheat is meant for other cheat developers.
